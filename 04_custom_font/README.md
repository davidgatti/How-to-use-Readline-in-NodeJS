Another interesting concept to understand when it comes to drawing on the screen is how to draw custom art/fonts. A good example could be that you want to display the time using the whole terminal screen with big numbers.

To do so, you will need to create a bunch of multidimensional arrays that will hole the information how to draw a custom graphic, similarly to the star example from before, but this time we donâ€™t need the size of the screen, since the array will have a fixed size (of course smaller then the overall screen size), for example 5x5 characters.
Once you have all the arrays that represent your custom character you just have to draw them on the screen similarly to the start example. This is how you do this, in a situation like this, in electronics, and this is how fonts and more in a modern operating stymie works, the difference is what the amount of data stored to represent a custom graphic.
